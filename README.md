### About This Repository

This repository contains an outdated version of the static frontend-based website for Savchenko Solutions. This version was actively developed between October 9, 2023, and November 8, 2024.

### Development History

In its initial phase, physics handouts were shared through manually created static web pages. As the number of publications grew, a Python-based system was introduced to auto-generate the main page, along with a graphical user interface for generating HTML pages. The GUI development later inspired the creation of the current online `Editor` tool.

Over time, the need for a dynamic website became evident to allow collaborators to contribute directly to the database. This led to the migration of hosting from GitHub Pages to AWS.

### Current Version

The updated and dynamic version of the platform is now hosted on AWS. The source code for this version is maintained in the up-to-date [repository](https://github.com/savchenko-physics/savchenko-solutions). For access to the latest features and updates, please refer to the linked repository.
