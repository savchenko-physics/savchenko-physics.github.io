<p>

The power of the light bulb, and as a consequence the intensity of the light bulb, remains constant, so the longer the light bulb is at a certain moment, the more energy comes to the eye. Because the human eye perceives and accumulates light energy at a particularly high frequency of change (more details: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/S0042-6989(99)00084-X">doi.org/10.1016/S0042-6989(99)00084-X</a>), then the longer the body is at a certain point, the brighter it seems to the retina of our eye</p><p>
The perceived energy is inversely proportional to the time spent in a given place:
$$ W\sim\Delta t $$
In harmonic motion, the position of the light bulb is described by the expression
$$ x(t) = x_0 \sin\omega t $$
From here, the speed value changes as
$$ v(t) = \dot{x}(t) =\omega \cdot x_0\cos \omega t $$
The lower the speed, the more time it takes for the light bulb to cover equal intervals of time.
$$ v\sim\frac{1}{\Delta t} $$
Thus, when the speed of the light bulb during harmonic motion is minimal, the energy perceived by the eye becomes greater.
$$ W\sim \frac{1}{v} $$
Thus, the bulb appears brighter in places where its speed is minimal, i.e. at its extreme points.
