        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $2.7.44.$ The moment of inertia of a solid body of mass $m$ relative to the $O$-axis is equal to $J$. The center of mass of the body is located at a distance $R$ from this axis. Find the force acting on the axis when a force $F$ is briefly applied to a solid body perpendicular to the segment of length $x$ that connects the point of application of the force and the axis. At which $x$ is the smallest force acting on the axis?

<p>
Force $\vec{F}$ creates an angular momentum $\vec{F}\cdot x$ (with $x$ perpendicular to $\vec{F}$):
$$\tau_0=F\cdot x$$
$$\tau_f=J\cdot\varepsilon $$
In steady-state mode, the angular moments will be equal
$$\tau_0=\tau_f=Fx=J\varepsilon $$
From where
$$\varepsilon = \frac{Fx}{J}$$
Newton's second law
$$F-F_0=m\varepsilon R$$
$$F_0=F-mR\cdot \frac{Fx}{J}\Leftrightarrow \boxed{F_0=F\left(1-\frac{mRx}{J}\right)}$$
From here, the minimum values of $F_0 = 0$, described by the expression
$$F_0=0\Leftrightarrow 1-\frac{mRx}{J}=0$$
which will be observed at length that connects the point of application of the force and the axis
$$\boxed{x=\frac{J}{mR}}$$
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $F'=F(1-mRx/J)$. With $x=J/(mR),~F'=0$
