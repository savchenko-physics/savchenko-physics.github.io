        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $1.2.13.$ "The ship was going at the limit, further acceleration was not provided for by the instructions of the space Fleet. An hour later, the speed increased by a thousand kilometers per second" (Kir Bulychev. Agent KF / / Chemistry and Life. 1984. No. 12, p. 111). Find the acceleration of the ship. How many times does it exceed the acceleration of gravity on Earth?
        </p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            1. Determine the acceleration of the ship
$$a=\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=278 \,\frac{m}{s}$$
2. Let's relate the acceleration of the spaceplane to the acceleration of free fall on Earth
$$\frac{a}{g}=27.8$$

        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $28 \text{ times}$
        </p>
