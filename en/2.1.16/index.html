        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $2.1.16.$ The body of mass $m$ is attached to two consecutive springs of stiffness $k_1$ and $k_2$. A constant force $F$ is applied to the free end of the spring chain. What is the total elongation of the springs, if the vibrations have already stopped?

<p>
1. When springs are connected in series, their deformation will be different with the same acting force, this circumstance allows us to determine the overall stiffness of the springs as follows
$$ \Delta x_0 = \Delta x_1 + \Delta x_2 = \frac{F}{k_1}+\frac{F}{k_2} = \frac{F}{k_0} $$

$$ \boxed{k_0 = \frac{k_1 k_2}{k_1 + k_2}} $$
2. The combined effect on the mass of the springs when the mass is at rest will be equal to the applied force $F$
$$ k_0 \Delta x_0 = F $$

$$ \boxed{ \Delta x_0 = \frac{F(k_1 + k_2)}{k_1 k_2}} $$

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$x = F(k_1 + k_2)/(k_1k_2)$$
