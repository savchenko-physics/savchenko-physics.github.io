        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $2.1.13.$ A system of three identical balls connected by identical springs is suspended on a thread. The thread is burned out. Find the acceleration of the balls immediately after burning the thread.
        </p>

<p>
Let's write the equilibrium condition for the two lower balls on the vertical and horizontal axes
$$
    		\left\{\begin{matrix}
            mg = F_1 \sin\alpha\\
            F_x = F_1 \cos\alpha&
            \end{matrix}\right. $$
where $P$ is the painter's pressure force on the chair. </p>
And for the upper ball
$$ T = mg + 2F_1 \sin\alpha$$

$$ T = 3mg $$
Accordingly, when the thread burns out, the upper ball will be acted upon downwards by a force of $T=3mg$. From Newton's second law, we find its initial acceleration as
$$ a = \frac{T}{m} = 3g $$
The lower balls will be acted upon in the horizontal direction by the force $F_x$, which will be compensated by the force $F_1 \cos\alpha$, and the force of gravity $mg$ — $F_1 \sin\alpha$
<p>
<p>
Thus, the lower balls will be in zero gravity
$$ a=0 $$
NO: Something similar happens when a Slinky falls

<p>
I recommend an interesting problem about Slinky <a href="https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/physprob.com/files/ipho/2019_Israel_p1.pdf" target="_blank">IPhO 2019 "Springs and Slinky"</a>
</p>
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            The acceleration of the upper ball is $3g$, and the acceleration of the lower balls is zero.
        </p>
