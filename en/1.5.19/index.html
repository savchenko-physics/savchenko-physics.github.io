        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $1.5.19.$ A spherical buoy of radius $R$ is attached to the bottom of the reservoir. The water level in the reservoir rises at a speed $u$. What is the speed of movement of the boundary of the flooded part of the buoy on its surface at the moment when the water level is $h$ above the center of the buoy?

<p>By time $t$ the water level will be $h$</p>
<p>In a short period of time $dt$ the water layer will rise by </p>
<p>
$$ dh = u \, dt $$
</p>
<p>In turn, the boundary of the flooded part will also rise by </p>
<p>
$$ dh = v\, dt \cos \alpha  $$
</p>
<p>Let's equate both equations</p>
<p>
$$ v \cos \alpha = u $$
</p>
    <p>
$$ v  = \frac{u}{\cos \alpha} $$
</p>
    <p>
$$ \fbox{$v  = u \frac{R}{\sqrt{R^2 - h^2}}$} $$
</p>
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$v  = u \frac{R}{\sqrt{R^2 - h^2}}$$
        </p>
