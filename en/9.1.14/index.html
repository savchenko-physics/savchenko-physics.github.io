        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $9.1.14.$ A ring of radius $R$, through which a current $I$ circulates, is placed in a non-uniform axially symmetric field. The axis of the ring coincides with the axis of symmetry of the magnetic field. The induction of the magnetic field $B$ acting on the current is directed at an angle $\alpha$ to the axis of symmetry of the field. The mass of the ring is $m$. Determine the acceleration of the ring.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            The ring will be accelerated by the tangential component of magnetic induction $B_{\|}$ since its perpendicular component $B_\bot$ is directed at the deformation of the ring. </p><p>
At each point of the ring this is $B\sin\alpha$ since the acceleration does not change direction when turning $dl$ then:
$$ ma = 2\pi RIB\sin\alpha\Rightarrow \boxed{a = 2\pi\frac{RIB\sin\alpha}{m}} $$

        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$a = 2\pi\frac{RIB\sin\alpha}{m} $$
