        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $9.1.7.$ A rectangular frame with current is placed in a uniform magnetic field. The magnetic induction B is parallel to the plane of the frame. The area of the frame is $S$, the current in it is $I$. </p><p>
a) Prove that the moment of forces acting on the frame is $N = BM$, where $M = IS$ is the magnetic moment of the frame. </p><p>
b) Prove that the moment of forces acting on the frame in the case when the magnetic induction is directed as shown in the figure is equal to $\vec{N} =[\vec{M} \times \vec{B} ]$ where $M$ is the magnetic moment of the frame, the modulus of which is equal to $IS$, and the direction is perpendicular to the plane of the frame.

        <h3>Proof</h3>
        <p>
            a) The moment of force will be created by the lines of the frame perpendicular to the lines of magnetic induction $B$. Let the frame have dimensions $a$ by $b$ (for definiteness, we will consider $b \bot B$), then the moment of the Ampere force will be:
$$ N = 2\cdot |\vec{Ib} \times \vec{B}|\cdot \frac{a}{2} = Ib \cdot B \cdot a $$
given the area of the frame $(S = ab)$, then the moment of forces acting on the frame
$$ \boxed{\boxed{N = IBS = BM}} $$
</p><p>
b) the perpendicular component of magnetic induction $B_{\bot}$ will be directed towards stretching the frame and will not create a moment of force $(N=0)$, while the moment created by $B_{\|}$ is
$$ N = B_{\|}IS = BIS\sin\alpha =|\vec{IS} \times \vec{B}| $$
since $\vec{N} = \vec{F} \times \vec{r}$, then it will be true that $\vec{N} = \vec{IS} \times \vec{B}$, because the direction of the moment is perpendicular to the force and the arm of the force
$$ \boxed{\boxed{\vec{N} = \vec{M} \times \vec{B}}} $$
