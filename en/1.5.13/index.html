        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $1.5.13.$ The rope tied to the boat is pulled by the free end so that it does not sag. The boat moves at a constant speed $v$, forming at some point in time an angle $\alpha$ with the length of rope located between the pole and the boat. How fast should the free end of the rope be pulled at this point in time?

      <p>Если веревка не провисает, то</p>
$$ \fbox{$u=\upsilon\cos\alpha$} $$
<p>And since all points of the rope have the same speed, the rope must be pulled with exactly the speed $u$.</p>
        </p>

        <h4>Answer:
            $u = v \cos\alpha$</h4>
