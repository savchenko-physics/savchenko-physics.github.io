Forces acting on the body

<p>
The body on the inclined plane is under the action of three forces: the force of gravity $\vec{F}_{1} = m \vec{g}$, the force of friction $\vec{F}_{2} = - \mu mg$ and the normal reaction of the constraint $\vec{N}$, however, when further considering the motion, the normal reaction can be ignored, since its projection onto the horizontal axis along which the body moves is equal to zero.
</p>
<p>
The equation of Newton's second law in projection onto the OX axis when the body moves upward in vector form is written as follows
$$ \vec{F}_{1} + \vec{F}_{2} = m \vec{a} $$
Let us determine the projections of the acting forces on the OX axis and write down the equation of Newton's second law
$$ F_{1x} = mg \sin\alpha , F_{2x} = \mu mg \cos\alpha$$

$$ \mu mg \cos\alpha + mg \sin\alpha = ma $$
We divide both parts of the last equation by the mass $m$ and express the magnitude of the acceleration
$$ a = g( \sin\alpha + \mu\cos\alpha ) $$
The time of the body's upward movement $t_1$ is determined from the condition that the speed at the end of the ascent is equal to zero
$$ 0 = v_{0} - at \Rightarrow t_{1} = \frac{v_{0} }{a} = \frac{v_{0} }{g ( \sin\alpha + \mu\cos\alpha ) } $$
The downward motion of the body corresponds to the equation
$$ mg \sin\alpha - \mu mg \cos\alpha = ma $$

$$ a = g( \sin\alpha - \mu\cos\alpha ) $$
The speed will become equal to $v_0$ only at the end of the descent, because the law of conservation of energy has not been repealed, therefore
$$ \frac{dv}{dt} = g( \sin\alpha + \mu\cos\alpha ) $$

$$ \int_{0}^{v_{0} } dv = g( \sin\alpha + \mu\cos\alpha ) = \int_{0}^{t_{2} } dt $$

$$ t_{2} = \frac{v_{0} }{g ( \sin\alpha + \mu\cos\alpha ) } $$
The required time will be determined as the sum $t = t_{1} + t_{2}$
$$ \boxed{t = \frac{2v_{0} \sin\alpha}{g( \sin^{2} \alpha - \mu^{2} \cos^{2} \alpha )}} $$
</p>
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$t = \frac{2v_{0} \sin\alpha}{g( \sin^{2} \alpha - \mu^{2} \cos^{2} \alpha )}$$
        </p>
