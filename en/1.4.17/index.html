        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $1.4.17.$ It is raining heavily. Drop rate $u$. The ball slides on the asphalt at a speed of $v$. How many times in the same period of time does it get more drops than the same, but stationary ball? Does the answer change if the ball is not round?
        </p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            <p>During time $t$, all the drops that are in a cylinder of height $ut$ and base area $S_1$ equal to the area of ​​the central cross-section of the ball perpendicular to $u$ fall on a stationary ball. That is, in the first case</p>
<p class="exp">$$N_1 = utS_1$$</p>
<p>In the second case, we move to the reference frame of a rolling ball, then the drops fall on it with a speed of </p>
<p class="exp">$$u_1 = \sqrt{u^2 + v^2}$$</p>
<p class="exp">$$N_2 = u_1 t S_2$$</p>
<p>where $S_2$ is equal to the area of ​​the central cross-section of the ball perpendicular to $u_1$. For a ball-ball $S_1 = S_2 = S$, and then</p>
<p class="exp">$$N_2 = \sqrt{u^2 + v^2} t S$$</p>
<p>Where we get the desired ratio</p>
<p class="exp">
$$ \fbox{$\dfrac{N_2}{N_1} = \sqrt{1 + \dfrac{v^2}{u^2}}$} $$
</p>
<p>When the ball has a shape different from a sphere, its cross-sectional area will vary from the plane of the section </p>
<p class="exp">$$S_1\neq S_2\neq S$$</p>
<p>Thus, the answer obtained will also vary depending on the shape of the ball </p>
<p >NO: For additional reading, I recommend the discussion of this problem on <a href="https://ask.bc-pf.org/t/zadacha-pro-dozhd-i-myach-zadachnik-1001/3855" target="_blank">ask.bc-pf.org</a> </p>
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            <p>More drops fall on a rolling ball in $\dfrac{N_2}{N_1} = \sqrt{1 + \dfrac{v^2}{u^2}}$ times.</p>
        </p>
