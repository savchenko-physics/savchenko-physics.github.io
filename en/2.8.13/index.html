        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $2.8.13.$ Rolling mill rolls have radius $R$. Rotating, they retract the workpiece, if its thickness is small enough. The coefficient of friction between the rolls and the workpiece is $\mu$, and the gap between the rolls is $d_0$. Find the maximum thickness of the blank. The blank is not pushed.

<p>

As the thickness of the workpiece increases, there will come a point where the mill rolls can no longer roll the workpiece.</p><p>
It will happen until the vertical projection of friction force $\vec{F}_\text{fr}$ will exceed the vertical component of the support reaction force $\vec{N}$
$$F_\text{fr}\cos\alpha\geq N\sin\alpha$$
Considering the value of friction force $F_\text{fr} = \mu N$:
$$\mu = \tan\alpha\quad(1)$$
From the drawing
$$\frac{d-d_0}{2} = R(1-\cos\alpha) \Rightarrow \boxed{d = d_0 + 2R(1-\cos\alpha)}\quad(2)$$
From the expression $(1)$,
$$\cos\alpha = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\tan^2\alpha}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\mu^2}}\quad(3)$$
After substituting $(3)$ into $(2)$, we could obtain the maximum thickness of the blank
$$\boxed{d = d_0 + 2R\left(1-\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\mu^2}}\right)}$$

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$d_\text{max}=d_0+2R\left(1-1/\sqrt{1+\mu^2} \right)$$
