          $2.4.34$
          Two loads of mass $m_1$ and $m_2$ ($m_1 > m_2$) are connected by a thread thrown over a fixed block. At the initial moment, the load of mass $m_1$  is held at a height $h$ above the floor. Then it is released without a push. How much heat will be released when the load hits the floor? The impact is absolutely inelastic.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            Applying Energy Conservation Law:
            $$m_1 g h = Q + m_2 g H\;(1)$$
            where $Q$ is lost energy by heat and $H$ is the height achieved by body of mass $m_2$ after the impact of body of mass $m_1$, and is given by,
            $$H = h + \frac{v^2}{2g}\;(2)$$
            Why? Potential energy of body 1 is converted in kinetic energy of body 1 and kinetic energy of body 2 with same velocity due to the constraint ($v_1=v_2=v$), after totally inelastic collision with ground, part of this energy is transformed in heat and the other one in potential energy for body 2, which behaves as a projectile launched vertically upwards from height $h$. For determining this velocity $v$, it's necessary to know what acceleration did the system have before impact. Applying Newton Second Law, for body 1:
            $$m_1 g - T = m_1 a \;(3)$$
            and for body 2,
            $$T - m_2 g = m_2 a\;(4)$$
            Suming up equations (3) and (4) side by side,
            $$a = \frac{m_1-m_2}{m_1+m_2}g\;(5)$$
            As $h = \frac{v^2}{2a}$, so,
            $$v = \sqrt{2ah}\;(6)$$
            Substituting (5) into (6),
            $$v = \sqrt{2gh\left(\frac{m_1-m_2}{m_1+m_2}\right)}\;(7)$$
            Putting (7) into (2)
            $$H = \frac{2m_1}{m_1+m_2}h\;(8)$$
            Finally, substituting (8) into (1) and separating $Q$,
        </p>
        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$Q = m_1gh \frac{m_1-m_2}{m_1+m_2}$$
