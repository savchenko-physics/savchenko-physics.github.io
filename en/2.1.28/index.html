        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $2.1.28.$ On an icy section of the highway, the coefficient of friction between the wheels and the road is ten times less than on an un-icy one. How many times do you need to reduce the speed of the car so that the braking distance on an icy section of the highway remains the same?
        </p>

<p>
1. The external force when the car is moving is the friction force $F = \mu mg$, therefore, without taking into account the resistance from the air, the dynamic equation of motion has the form
$$ ma = \mu mg $$

$$ a = \mu g $$
2. The kinematic equations of motion in this case are represented as follows:
$$ \left\{\begin{matrix}
          v = v_0-at \\
          x=v_0-\frac{at^2}{2}
          \end{matrix}\right. $$

$$ t=\frac{v_0}{a}=\frac{v_0}{\mu g} $$
3. When substituting the values ​​of acceleration and time into the second equation, we obtain the equation for the braking distance of a car
$$ x=\frac{v_0^2}{\mu g}-\frac{v_0^2}{2\mu g}=\frac{v_0^2}{2\mu g} $$

$$ v_0 = \sqrt{2\mu gx} $$
Hence the speed needs to be
reduced by $\sqrt{10}$ times

        <h4>Answer: $\sqrt{10}$ times</h4>
