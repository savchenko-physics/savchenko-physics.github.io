        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
          $11.2.2$
          The induction of a uniform magnetic field inside a cylinder of radius $r$ = 0.1 m increases linearly with time: $B = \alpha t$ (coefficient $\alpha$ = 10$^{-3}$ T/s). The magnetic field is directed along the axis of the cylinder. What is the strength of the eddy electric field at a distance of $l$ = 0.2 m from the cylinder axis? 
        </p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
          Magnetic field passes through an area of $\pi r^2$ m$^2$ and its flux increases with time. So, this causes that appears a rotational electric field around cylinder axis such that its induced magnetic field opposes to $\vec{B}(t)$ (Lenz Law). Applying Faraday's Law,
          $$\oint\vec{E}\cdot \vec{ds} = \frac{d\Phi_B}{dt}$$
          this closed integral is for concentric circular paths about cylinder's axis. Then, for a distance $a$ from center,
          $$E(a) \cdot 2\pi a = \pi r^2 \alpha$$
          $$E(a) = \frac{\alpha r^2}{2a}$$
          Finally, evaluating for $a=l$,
          $$E = \frac{\alpha r^2}{2l}$$
        </p>
        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$E = 2.5~\cdot~10^{-5}~{\rm{\frac{V}{m}}}$$
