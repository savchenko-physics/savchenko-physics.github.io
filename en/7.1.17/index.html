        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $7.1.17^*$
            There are two diametrically opposed holes in a non-conductive thin-walled sphere with an uniformly distributed charge $Q$ which has mass $M$. At the initial istant, the sphere is in rest. Certain particle of mass $m$ and charge $q$ (same sign of $Q$) is moved from infinite with speed $v$ over line that join the holes. Determine the time which particle will be inside the sphere.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            Firstly, we consider the situation before $q$-particle penetrates $Q$-sphere. Since both bodies have equal-sign charges, $q$-particle will move with a deacceleration while $Q$-sphere will accelerate.
            Applying Energy Conservation Law (from the beginning until $q$-particle reaches $Q$-sphere surface)
            $$\frac{mv^2}{2} = \frac{mv_q^2}{2}+\frac{kQq}{R}+\frac{Mv_Q^2}{2} \;(1)$$
            From Momentum Conservation Law
            $$mv = mv_q + Mv_Q \;(2)$$
            Inside of $Q$-sphere, there is no electric field, then both bodies have constant velocities while $q$-particle be inside $Q$-sphere (see Figure). The displacement of $q$-particle is

            $$\Delta S_q = \Delta S_Q+2R = v_q~T \;(3)$$
            And the sphere's displacement is 
            $$\Delta S_Q = v_Q~T \;(4)$$
            From $(4)$ in $(3)$, and separating $T$
            $$T = \frac{2R}{v_q-v_Q} \;(5)$$
            Separating $v_q$ from $(2)$
            $$v_q = v - \frac{M}{m}v_Q \;(6)$$
            Putting $(6)$ into $(1)$ and developing algebraically
            $$0 = \frac{M}{2}\left(1+\frac{M}{m}\right)v_Q^2-Mv~v_Q + \frac{kQq}{R} \;(7)$$
            $(7)$ is a second-degree equation or quadratic equation in $v_Q$ ($AX^2+BX+C=0$). We can solve this by Discriminant method or General-Solution formula for quadratic equations. The Discriminant is
            $$D = B^2-4AC$$
            $$D = M^2v^2-2M\left(1+\frac{M}{m}\right)\frac{kQq}{R}$$
            The solutions are
            $$X = \frac{-B\pm\sqrt{D}}{2A}$$
            $$v_Q = \frac{Mv\pm\sqrt{M^2v^2-2M\left(1+\frac{M}{m}\right)\frac{kQq}{R}}}{M\left(1+\frac{M}{m}\right)} \;(8)$$
            Substituting $(6)$ into $(5)$
            $$T = \frac{2R}{v-v_Q\left(1+\frac{M}{m}\right)} \;(9)$$
            Putting $(8)$ into $(9)$
            $$T = \frac{2MR}{\mp\sqrt{M^2v^2-2M\left(1+\frac{M}{m}\right)\frac{kQq}{R}}}$$
            Choosing ``plus'' (+) sign, because time is non-negative, taking $k = 1/(4\pi\epsilon_0)$ and developing
            $$\boxed{T = \frac{2R}{v}\left[1-\frac{qQ(M+m)}{2\pi\epsilon_0mMv^2}\right]^{-\frac{1}{2}}}$$
            This is valid for $\frac{\mu v^2}{2}>\frac{qQ}{4\pi\epsilon_0R}$, where $\mu = \frac{mM}{M+m}$ is the reduced mass.
