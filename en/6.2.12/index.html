        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            The idea for solving this problem is to consider superposition principle: as cavity is uncharged, we can suppose that it exists a superposition of a plate (with charge density $\rho$) and a sphere with charge density $-\rho$. So, if we analyze the field in $A$ without cavity, we have two plates of thickness $\frac{h}{2}$, one over $A$ and the other one under A, both with charge density $\rho$, then field in $A$ is null. While for $A$ in the sphere's surface, applying Gauss's Law,
            $$-E_A\cdot 4\pi\left(\frac{h}{2}\right)^2 = -\frac{q_{enc}}{\varepsilon_0}$$
            as $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi\left(\frac{h}{2}\right)^3$, so $6\frac{V}{h} = 4\pi\left(\frac{h}{2}\right)^2$, and taking in account that $\rho = \frac{q_{enc}}{V}$
        </p>
        <h4>Answer 1</h4>
        <p>
            $$E_A = \frac{\rho h}{6\varepsilon_0}$$
        </p>

        <p>
            For point $B$, the way is similar: in this case the plate without cavity generates certain field in $B$, located on its surface. From Gauss's Law
            $$E_p\cdot S = \frac{q_t}{\varepsilon_0}$$
            as $S = \frac{V}{h}$, and $\rho = \frac{q_t}{V}$
            $$E_p = \frac{\rho h}{\varepsilon_0}$$
            but, for one of the side of plate, field is $E_B' = \frac{E_p}{2}  = \frac{\rho h}{2\varepsilon_0}$
            Now, overlapping with field generated by sphere,
            $$E_B = E_B' - E_c$$
            where $E_c = E_A$,
        </p>
        <h4>Answer 2</h4>
        <p>
            $$E_B = \frac{\rho h}{3\varepsilon_0}$$
        </p>

        <p>
            As $A$ is on line $OA$, all points over that line "feel" only the electric field generated by sphere. From Gauss's Law
            $$-E(r) \cdot 4\pi r^2 = -\frac{q_{enc}}{\varepsilon_0}$$
            as $V = \frac{4}{3}\pi r^3$, so $3\frac{V}{r} = 4\pi r^2$, and $\rho = \frac{q_{enc}}{V}$
        </p>
        <h4>Answer 3</h4>
        <p>
            $$E(r) = \frac{\rho r}{3\varepsilon_0}$$
            for $0\leq r \leq \frac{h}{2}$.
