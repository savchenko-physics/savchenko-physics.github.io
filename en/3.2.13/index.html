        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $3.2.13.$ A straight tunnel is dug in the Earth that does not pass through its center. Determine the time of movement of a train with engines turned off through such a tunnel if the influence of the Earth's rotation on the movement of the train and friction are neglected.

Similarly to <a href="../3.2.12">3.2.12</a>, we find the external force $F$ as</p><p>

The body, at a distance $x$ from the core, will be affected by the gravitational force of attraction caused by the inner layers of the planet with density $\rho$, forming a sphere of radius $x$. The mass of this part of the earth
$$ M_\oplus = \frac{4}{3} \rho\pi x^3 $$
Gravitational force acting on a rock at depth $x$
$$ F_G = \frac{GmM_\oplus}{x^2}=mg\frac{x}{R} $$
In this case, only the horizontal component of this force will create a moment. Whence, the resulting external force is equal to
$$ F=mg\cos\alpha=mg\frac{x}{R} $$
From here we find the angular frequency of oscillations
$$ \omega=\sqrt{\frac{g}{R}} $$
The period of oscillation in a given system
$$ T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{R}{g}} $$
Since we are interested in the flight time only in one direction, we take half of this period.
$$ \boxed{t=\frac{T}{2}=\pi\sqrt{\frac{R}{g}}\approx42\text{ min}} $$
