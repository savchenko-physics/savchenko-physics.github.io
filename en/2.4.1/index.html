        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $2.4.1.$ Balls of mass $m$, each connected by a thread, move in a circle with a constant velocity $v$. The kinetic energy of each ball, equal to $\frac{mv^2}{2}$, does not change. If we switch to a reference frame in which the center of the thread moves in a straight line in the plane of rotation at a speed $,$ the energy of each of the balls changes from zero to $4 \frac{mv^2}{2}$. What causes this energy change? Does the total kinetic energy change in the specified reference frame?
        </p>

<p>

In the initial, stationary frame of reference, the energy of the system is
$$E_{k1} = 2\frac{mv^2}{2}$$
Velocity of the system
$$v_s = \frac{mv+mv}{2m} = v$$
In the inertial frame of reference of the system moving with velocity $\vec{v}$
$$E_{k2} = 0 +\frac{m(2v)^2}{2}=4 \frac{mv^2}{2}$$
To go to the inertial frame of reference, it is necessary to give the system of total mass $2m$ a velocity $v$
$$\Delta E_k = \frac{2mv^2}{2}$$
Thus, the law of conservation of energy is fulfilled and there is no change in total kinetic energy in the reference frame
$$\boxed{E_{k2} = E_{k1} + \Delta E_k}$$
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            In a moving frame of reference, the tension force does work. No.
