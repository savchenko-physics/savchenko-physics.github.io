        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $2.1.6.$ Two bodies of mass $m_1$ and $m_2$ are connected by a thread that can withstand the tension force $T$. Forces $F_1 = \alpha t$ and $F_2 = 2 \alpha t$ are applied to the bodies, where $\alpha$ is a constant coefficient, and $t$ is the time of action of the force. Determine at what point in time the thread will break.

<p>
Let's write Newton's second law for both bars along the horizontal axis
$$ \left\{\begin{matrix}
m_2 a = F_2 - T\\
m_1 a = T - F_1
\end{matrix}\right. $$
</p>
<p>
Reduce for acceleration $a$
$$ \frac{m_2}{m_1} = \frac{F_2 - T}{T - F_1} $$

$$ \frac{m_2}{m_1} = \frac{2\alpha t - T}{T - \alpha t} $$
Express $T$
$$ T = \alpha t \frac{2m_1+m_2}{m_1+m_2} $$
Where does the time until the thread breaks $T$ come from?
$$ \fbox{$t = \frac{T}{\alpha}\frac{m_1 + m_2}{(2m_1 + m_2)}$} $$
</p>
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$t = \frac{T}{\alpha}\frac{m_1 + m_2}{(2m_1 + m_2)}$$
        </p>
