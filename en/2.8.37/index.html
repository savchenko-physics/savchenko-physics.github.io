        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $2.8.37^*.$ A wheel of radius $R$ can rotate freely around its axis. Drive belts moving at a speed $v$ are pressed against the side surface of the wheel at a distance $h$ from the axis of rotation. Determine the steady-state angular velocity of the wheel if its contact with the drive belt occurs only along the rim.

      <p>
      In order for the wheel to move it is necessary that a moment of force associated with the frictional force from drive belts is transmitted, which is directed along the axis of rotation.
        </p>

      <p>
      Thus, the momentum will make an angle with velocity $v$ equal to $\pi -\alpha$
        </p>
      <p>
          Projecting onto the linear rotation speed of the wheel:
          $$u=v\cos(\frac{\pi}{2}-\alpha )=v\sin\alpha\quad(1)$$
          From the drawing
          $$\sin\alpha = \frac{h}{R}$$
          Substituting into $(1)$
          $$u=v \frac{h}{R}$$
          From where we find the linear velocity, given that the wheel is circular
          $$\boxed{\omega =\frac{u}{R}=v \frac{h}{R^2}}$$
        </p>


        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$\omega =\frac{hv}{R^2}$$
        </p>
