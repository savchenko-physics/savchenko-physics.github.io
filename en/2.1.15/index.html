        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $2.1.15.$ The body of mass $m$ is connected by two springs of stiffness $k_1$ and $k_2$ with fixed walls, the springs are not initially deformed. When vibrations occur, the greatest acceleration of the body is $a$. Find the maximum deviation of the body from the equilibrium position and the maximum forces with which the springs act on the walls.

<p>
1. The springs in this problem are connected in parallel, their deformation is the same
$$ Δx_1 = Δx_2 = Δx $$
2. The force acting on the mass from the springs is determined as the sum
$$ F = F + F_1 $$
alternatively
$$ k \Delta x = k_1  \Delta x + k_2 \Delta x $$
3. Let us write down the equation of motion of the mass under the action of an equivalent spring with stiffness ko, which will allow us to determine the maximum displacement
$$ ma = (k_1 + k_2) \Delta x_{max} $$

$$ \Delta x_{max} = ma/(k_1 + k_2) $$
4. Maximum values of forces acting on the mass
$$ {F_1}_{max} = k_1 \Delta x_{max} $$

$$ {F_2}_{max} = k_2 \Delta x_{max} $$

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
                    <p>
        	$$x_{max} = ma/(k_1 + k_2);$$
        	$${F_1}_{max} = k_1x_{max}$$
        	$${F_2}_{max} = k_2x_{max}$$
