          $10.2.8$
          A plane capacitor is placed in a homogeneous magnetic field od induction $B$ parallel to the plates. From point A, electrons enter perpendicularly to magnetic field direction. The tension (voltage) applied to the plates is $V$. What is the condition for which electrons pass through the capacitor?

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
          Electrons pass through capacitor if they don't collide with plates. So, supposing a capacitor of infinite length, electron's velocity must be parallel to the plates (or its horizontal range over a plate greater than its enter's height). This is possible if electric and magnetic forces are in equilibrium (equal absolute values and opposed directions).
          $$evB = eE$$
          $$v = \frac{E}{B}$$
          As $E=\frac{V}{h}$,
          $$\boxed{v = \frac{V}{Bh}}$$
          This device is known as speed's selector.
