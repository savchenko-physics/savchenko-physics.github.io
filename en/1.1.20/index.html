        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $1.1.20^*.$ A ball is launched along a pool table with sides $a$ and $b$ from the middle of side $b$. At what angle to the side of the table must the ball begin to move to return to the same point from which it began its movement?

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            
            <p>
              By analogy with <a href="../1.1.18">1.1.18</a>, we can use the Image Method and represent elastic walls as optical mirrors.  
            </p>

            <p>
              To get to the starting position, all you have to do is hit any of the picture holes. 
            </p>
            <p>
              The coordinates of the holes are described by the expression: 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              $x=2ma$ и $y=nb$, где $m$ и $n$ — any integers
            </p>
            <p>
              Whence the desired angle:" 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              $\alpha = arctg (2ma/(nb))$ 
            </p>
            
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $\tan \alpha = 2ma/(nb)$, where $m$ and $n$ are any integers
        </p>
