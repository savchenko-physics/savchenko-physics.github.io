        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $1.1.6.$ Athletes run in a column of length $l$ at speed $v$. The coach runs towards them with speed $u < v$. Each athlete, when he reaches the coach, turns around and starts running back with the same speed. What is the length of the column when all the athletes turn around?
        </p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
                            <p class="TxtSolutions">   Let us imagine stopping the column, then the coach besides his speed will have the speed of the column directed in the opposite direction. With this relative velocity $v + u$ he will during time
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    $$t = \frac{l}{v + u}$$
                </p>
                <p class="TxtSolutions">  will run along the column and equalise with the tail. The head of the column, having turned round, will move with relative velocity $v - u$ and after time
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    $$t = \frac{{l}'}{v - u}$$
                </p>
                <p class="TxtSolutions">   where ${l}'$ is the length of the new “column” after overtaking. Then
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    $$\frac{{l}'}{v - u} = \frac{l}{v + u}$$
                </p>
                <p class="TxtSolutions">   and the length of the new column
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center;">
                    $$\fbox{${l}' = \frac{v - u}{v + u}l$}$$
                </p>
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            When all athletes turn around, the length of the new column will be equal to ${l}' = \frac{v - u}{v + u}l$
        </p>
