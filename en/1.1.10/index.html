        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $1.1.10^*.$ A bus is driving along a straight highway at constant speed $v$. You have noticed the bus when it was at some point $A$. From what area near the highway can you catch up with this bus if your running speed is $u < v$? Draw this area for $u = v/2$.

              1. Let the bus is at point $A$, and the catching up person starts from point $B$ and runs perpendicular to the roadway $AC$. Let us introduce the notations: $AC = L, BC = h, AB = s.$
