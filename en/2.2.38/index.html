        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $2.2.38.$ A water jet boat moves in calm water. Force of water resistance to boat movement $F = k v^2$ . The speed of the ejected water relative to the boat $u$. Determine the steady-state speed of the boat, if the cross-section of the flow of water captured by the engine is $S$, the water density is $\rho$.

Since in steady-state mode remains unchanged, by Newton's first law, the thrust force is compensated by the drag force
$$F_\text{resistance}=F_\text{traction}$$

During the time $dt$ the mass $dm$ of escaping water is:
$$dm=\rho S v\,dt$$
In this case, relative to the Non-inertial Reference Frame, the water flies out with a velocity $u-v$.
</p><p>
Hence the momentum $dp$ of mass $dm$
$$dp=\rho S v(u-v)\,dt$$
The force of water thrust, we find through the change of momentum
$$F=\frac{dp}{dt}=\rho S v(u-v)$$
Let's substitute and rewrite the equilibrium condition
$$\rho S v(u-v)=k v^2$$
From where
$$\boxed{v=u \frac{\rho S}{\rho S+k}}$$
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$v=\rho Su/(\rho S+k)$$
        </p>
