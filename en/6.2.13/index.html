        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            Here, the idea for solving the problem is to use superposition's principle: considering a sphere of radius $R$ (bigger one) with bulk charge density $\rho$ and smaller one with bulk charge density $-\rho$, such that when superposition occurs, the cavity have no charge. Moreover, let's consider the following figure for organizing the solving process.

        <p>
            Above picture shows four regions to study. Let's begin with first one... Applying Gauss's Law for bigger sphere (without cavity) at distance $x$ from its center,
            $$E_b(x)\cdot 4\pi x^2 = \frac{q_{enc}}{\varepsilon_0} = \frac{\rho\cdot 4\pi x^3}{3\varepsilon_0}$$
            $$E_b(x) = \frac{\rho x}{3\varepsilon_0} \;(1)$$
            while for smaller one,
            $$E_s(r')\cdot 4\pi r'^2 = \frac{q_{enc}'}{\varepsilon_0} = \frac{\rho\cdot 4\pi r^3}{3\varepsilon_0}$$
            $$E_s(r') = \frac{\rho r^3}{3 r'^2 \varepsilon_0} \;(2)$$
            In this region $\vec{E_b}\uparrow\uparrow \vec{E_s}$, overlapping
            $$E(x,r') = E_s(r') + E_b(x) \;(3)$$
            Putting (1) and (2) into (3),
            $$E(x,r') = \frac{\rho}{3\varepsilon_0}\left(x+\frac{r^3}{r'^2}\right)$$
            but $r' = l-x$, so
        </p>
        <h4>Answer 1</h4>
        <p>
            $$E_I(x) = \frac{\rho}{3\varepsilon_0}\left[x+\frac{r^3}{(l-x)^2}\right]$$
            for $0\leq x\leq l-r$.
        </p>

        <p>
           For region II, let's separate region in two subregions II$_1$ and II$_2$. For first subregion, field generated by bigger sphere (without cavity) is given by (1). While for smaller one,
           $$E_s(r')\cdot 4\pi r'^2 = \frac{q_{enc}'}{\varepsilon_0} = \frac{\rho\cdot 4\pi r'^3}{3\varepsilon_0}$$
           $$E_s(r') = \frac{\rho r'}{3\varepsilon_0} \;(4)$$
           In this subregion, $\vec{E_s}\uparrow\uparrow \vec{E_b}$, so overlapping
           $$E_{II_1}(x,r') = E_s(r') + E_b(x) \;(5)$$
           Substituting (1) and (4) into (5),
           $$E_{II_1}(x,r') = \frac{\rho}{3\varepsilon_0}(x+r')$$
           but $l=x+r'$, hence
           $$E_{II_1} = \frac{\rho l}{3\varepsilon_0}$$
           For second subregion, field generated by bigger sphere (without cavity) still given by (1) and the generated one by smaller sphere is given by (4), but $\vec{E_s}\uparrow\downarrow\vec{E_b}$, so overlapping
           $$E_{II_2}(x,r') = E_b(x) - E_s(r') \;(6)$$
           Putting (1) and (4) into (6)
           $$E_{II_2}(x,r') = \frac{\rho}{3\varepsilon_0}(x-r')$$
           but in this case $l = x-r'$,
           $$E_{II_2} = \frac{\rho l}{3\varepsilon_0}$$
           Finally, $E_{II_1} = E_{II_2} = E_{II}$
        </p>
        <h4>Answer 2</h4>
        <p>
            $$E_{II} = \frac{\rho l}{3\varepsilon_0}$$
            for $l-r\leq x \leq l+r$
        </p>

        <p>
            For region III, smaller-sphere's field is given by (2), while bigger-sphere's field is given by (1), as $\vec{E_s}\uparrow\downarrow\vec{E_b}$, overlapping
            $$E_{III}(r',x) = E_b(x) - E_s(r') \;(7)$$
            Putting (1) and (2) into (7)
            $$E_{III}(x,r') = \frac{\rho}{3\varepsilon_0}\left(x - \frac{r^3}{r'^2}\right)$$
            as $r' = x-l$,
        </p>
        <h4>Answer 3</h4>
        <p>
            $$E_{III}(x) = \frac{\rho}{3\varepsilon_0}\left[x-\frac{r^3}{(x-l)^2}\right]$$
            for $l+r \leq x \leq R$.
        </p>

        <p>
           For region IV (points outside bigger sphere), applying Gauss's Law for bigger sphere,
           $$E_b(x) \cdot 4\pi x^2 = \frac{q_{enc}}{\varepsilon_0} = \frac{\rho\cdot 4\pi R^3}{3\varepsilon_0}$$
           $$E_b(x) = \frac{\rho R^3}{3\varepsilon_0 x^2} \;(8)$$ 
           while for smaller one, field is given by (4). Since $\vec{E_s}\uparrow\downarrow\vec{E_b}$, overlapping
           $$E_{IV}(x,r') = E_b(x) - E_s(r') \;(9)$$
           Putting (4) and (8) into (9)
           $$E_{IV}(x,r') = \frac{\rho}{3\varepsilon_0}\left(\frac{R^3}{x^2}-\frac{r^3}{r'^2}\right)$$
           but $l = x-r'$,
        </p>
        <h4>Answer 4</h4>
        <p>
            $$E_{IV}(x) = \frac{\rho}{3\varepsilon_0}\left[\frac{R^3}{x^2}-\frac{r^3}{(x-l)^2}\right]$$
            for $x > R$.
        </p>
        <p>
            For proofing the homogenity of field inside cavity, let's consider any point P inside cavity. Absolute value of bigger-sphere's field is given by (1) and directed over $\hat{x}$ direction, while absolute value of smaller-sphere's field is given by (4) and directed over $-\hat{r'}$ direction. Overlapping
            $$\vec{E}(x,r') = \vec{E_b}(x) + \vec{E_s}(r') = E_b(x) \hat{x} - E_s(r') \hat{r'} \;(10)$$ 
            Substituting (1) and (4) into (10)
            $$\vec{E}(x,r') = \frac{\rho}{3\varepsilon_0}(x\hat{x}-r'\hat{r'})$$ 
            $$\vec{E}(x,r') = \frac{\rho}{3\varepsilon_0}(vec{x}-\vec{r'})$$
            but $\vec{l} = \vec{x} -\vec{r'}$, hence
            $$\vec{E} = \frac{\rho\vec{l}}{3\varepsilon_0}$$
        </p>
        <h4>Answer 5</h4>
        <p>
            Since E is constant, it is homogeneous inside cavity.
