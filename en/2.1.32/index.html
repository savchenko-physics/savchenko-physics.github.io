            $2.1.32.$ Determine the force acting on the vertical wall from the side of the wedge, if a weight of mass $m$ is placed on it. Angle at the base of the wedge $\alpha$. Coefficient of friction between the load and the wedge surface $\mu$. There is no friction between the floor and the wedge.

<p>
The occurrence of an action on the wedge from the chalk is due to the accelerated movement of the body along the wedge
</p>
<p>
The movement becomes possible under the condition
$$ mg \sin\alpha \geq \mu mg  \cos\alpha $$
otherwise, the body will be at rest, and acceleration will not occur.
</p>
<p>
Using the principles of liberation, we will represent the body as a free material particle under the action of a system of forces $\{mg; F_\tau\}$
</p>
<p>
The equation of Newton's second law in projection onto the direction of motion of the body will be represented as follows:
$$ ma_x=mg \sin\alpha - \mu mg  \cos\alpha $$

$$ a_x=g \sin\alpha - \mu g  \cos\alpha $$
Force acting on the wedge and the vertical wall
$$ F = mg  \cos\alpha (\sin\alpha - \mu  \cos\alpha) $$
</p>
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            <p>
          $F=mg\operatorname{\cos}\alpha(\operatorname{sin}\alpha-\mu\operatorname{\cos}\alpha)$ with $\mu\leqslant\operatorname{tg}\alpha$;
        </p>
        <p>
          $F=0$ with $\mu\geqslant\operatorname{tg}\alpha$
        </p>
        </p>
