        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            a) The period of oscillation of a mathematical pendulum
$$ T_{0}=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{l}{g}}; \quad T =  \frac{2\pi}{\omega}\quad(1) $$
Harmonic oscillation equation
$$ m\ddot{x}=- (mg + F)\sin\varphi = - (mg + F)\frac{x}{l} $$
Where does the angular frequency of oscillations come from?
$$ \omega = \sqrt{\frac{mg+F}{ml}} $$
From $(1)$
$$ \frac{T^{2}}{T_{0}^{2}}=\frac{mg}{mg + F} \Rightarrow \fbox{$F =\frac{mg(T_{0}^{2}-T^{2})}{T^{2}}$} $$
b) For the second case, we write the equation of harmonic oscillations
$$ m\ddot{x}=- \left(\sqrt{(mg)^{2} + F^{2}}\right)\sin\varphi $$
Given the approximation value $\sin\varphi =\frac{x}{l}$
$$ m\ddot{x} = - \left(\sqrt{(mg)^{2} + F^{2}}\right)\cdot\frac{x}{l} $$
Solving the equation of harmonic oscillations of the form $\ddot{x}+\omega^2x=0$, we obtain the angular frequency
$$ \omega =\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{(mg)^{2}+F^{2}}}{ml}} $$
Similarly, substituting into $(1)$
$$ \frac{T_{0}^{4}}{T^{4}} = \frac{(mg)^{2}+ F^{2}}{(mg)^{2}} \Rightarrow  \fbox{$F = mg\sqrt{\frac{T_{0}^{4}-T^{4}}{T^{4}}}$} $$

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$F =\frac{mg(T_{0}^{2}-T^{2})}{T^{2}};\quad F = mg\sqrt{\frac{T_{0}^{4}-T^{4}}{T^{4}}}$$
