$a)$ By time $t$, the water level will be $v_0t$. And the rate of change of volume will be equal to:
$$\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{\pi r(t)^2 dx}{dt}$$
Where $dx$ is the change in water level:

$$\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r(t)^2 v_0$$

From Geometry, 
$$r(t) = v_0 t \cdot tg(\alpha)$$

By definition, the velocity of incoming water is equal to 
$$v = \frac{dV}{sdt}$$

Substituting the previous expressions: 
$$v = {\pi v_0^3 t^2 \cdot tg^2(\alpha)}/s$$

$b)$ For a small time interval $dt$, the volume changes by 
$$dV = q dt$$

Also the volume increment can be written as 
$$dV = 2\pi r dr \cdot h $$

Thus:

$$ q dt = 2\pi r dr \cdot h$$

Considering $v = \frac{dr}{dt}$,
$$ \fbox{$v = \frac{q}{2\pi r h}$}$$
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$v=\frac{\pi v_0^3t^2\operatorname{tg}^2\alpha}{s}$$
$$v=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{q}{\pi ht}}$$
        </p>
