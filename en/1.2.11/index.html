            $1.2.11.$ a. In a conical vessel, the water level rises at a constant rate $v_0$. How does the rate of water entering a vessel through a tube of section $s$ depend on time? At time zero, the vessel is empty.

b. A jet of oil hitting the surface of the water spreads over it in a round spot of thickness $h$. How does the speed of movement of the spot boundary depend on time, if the volume of oil $q$ enters per unit of time? At the initial time, the spot radius is zero.

$a)$ By time $t$, the water level will be $v_0t$. And the rate of change of volume will be equal to:
$$\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{\pi r(t)^2 dx}{dt}$$
Where $dx$ is the change in water level:

$$\frac{dV}{dt} = \pi r(t)^2 v_0$$

From Geometry, 
$$r(t) = v_0 t \cdot \tan\alpha$$

By definition, the velocity of incoming water is equal to 
$$v = \frac{dV}{sdt}$$

Substituting the previous expressions: 
$$v = {\pi v_0^3 t^2 \cdot \tan^2(\alpha )}/s$$

$b)$ For a small time interval $dt$, the volume changes by 
$$dV = q dt$$

Also the volume increment can be written as 
$$dV = 2\pi r dr \cdot h $$

Thus:

$$ q dt = 2\pi r dr \cdot h$$

Considering $v = \frac{dr}{dt}$,
$$ \fbox{$v = \frac{q}{2\pi r h}$}$$
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$v=\frac{\pi v_0^3t^2\operatorname{tg}^2\alpha}{s}$$
$$v=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{q}{\pi ht}}$$
        </p>
