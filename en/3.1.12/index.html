        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            a) Equality of forces in the equilibrium position
$$ mg=\frac{kq^2}{R^2}\Rightarrow kq^2=mgR^2 $$

$$ F'=F-mg=\frac{mgR^2}{R^2+2Rx+x^2}-mg $$

$$ F'=\frac{mgR^2-mgR^2-2mgRx-mgx^2}{(R+x)^2} $$
Using the approximation for $x\ll R$
$$ F'\approx-\frac{2mgRx}{(R+x)^2} $$
Next we will use approximations: $(1+x)^\alpha
$$ \approx1+\alpha x$, где $x\ll1$
 $$
F'=-\frac{2mgRx}{(R+x)^2}\approx-2mgRx\frac{1}{R^2}(1-2\frac{x}{R})
$$
 $$
F'=-\frac{2mgx}{R}-\frac{4mgx^2}{R^2}
$$
Given $x \ll R$, we neglect the term with $R^2$ $$
\boxed{F'\approx-\frac{2mgx}{R}}
$$
b) Next, we write down the system of equilibrium equations for the system
 $$
\left\{\begin{matrix}3mg=\frac{kq^2}{x^2}
    \\ mg=\frac{kq^2}{R^2}
\end{matrix}\right.
$$

Now let's find at what distance from the lower end of the spoke the equilibrium position of the body is located.
 $$
\frac{R}{x}=\sqrt{3}\Rightarrow \boxed{x=\frac{R}{\sqrt{3}}}
$$
The force acting on a body depends on its small displacement from the equilibrium position
 $$
\boxed{F''=-\frac{2m'gx}{R'}=-\frac{6mgx}{R'}}$$
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$F=-\frac{2mgx}{R};\quad R'=\frac{R}{\sqrt{3}};\quad F'=-\frac{6mgx}{R'}$$
