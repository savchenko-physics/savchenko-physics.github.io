        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $1.2.21^*.$ The scheduled departure time of the train is $12.00$. It's $12.00$ on your watch, but the penultimate car that moves past you during time $t_1$ is already starting to pass by you.
The last car passes you during $t_2$. The train left on time and is moving equidistant. How far behind is your watch?
        </p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            $$l=\nu _{1}t_{1} +\frac{at_{1}^{2}}{2}$$

$$l=(\nu _{1}+at_{1})t_{2} +\frac{at_{1}^{2}}{2}$$

$$(\nu _{1}+at_{1})t_{2} +\frac{at_{1}^{2}}{2} = \nu _{1}t_{1} +\frac{at_{1}^{2}}{2}$$
Given that $\nu _{1} = a{d}t$:
$$a{d}t(t_{1}-t_{2}) =\frac{a(t_{2}-2t_{1}t_{2}-t_{1}^{2})}{2}$$
$${d}t=\fbox{$\frac{t_{2}-2t_{1}t_{2}-t_{1}^{2}}{2(t_{1}-t_{2})}$}$$

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$\frac{t_{2}-2t_{1}t_{2}-t_{1}^{2}}{2(t_{1}-t_{2})}$$
