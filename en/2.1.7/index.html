        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $2.1.7.$ To measure the mass of an astronaut on an orbital station, a movable seat of known mass $m_0$ attached to a spring is used. With the same initial spring deformation (compression), the empty seat returns to its original position after a time $t_0$, but if the astronaut is on the seat, it returns after a time $t > t_0$. What is the mass of an astronaut?
        </p>

<p>
Let's write Newton's second law with an astronaut
$$ kx_2 = (m_0 + m) a_2 $$
And with an empty chair
$$ kx_1 = m_0 a_1 $$
Let's take into account uniformly accelerated motion
$$ \left\{\begin{matrix}
		k \frac{a_1t_0^2}{2} = m_0 a_1\\
		k \frac{a_2t^2}{2} = (m_0+m) a_2
		\end{matrix}\right. $$
From the first equation
$$ k = \frac{2m_0}{t_0^2} $$
We substitute into the second
$$ \fbox{$m = m_0(\frac{t^2}{t^2_0} − 1)$} $$
</p>
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$m = m_0[(t/t_0)^2 − 1]$$
