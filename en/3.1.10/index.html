        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $3.1.10^*.$ A bead with charge $q$ can move without friction along a stretched string of length $2 L$ with charges $Q$ attached to its ends. Find the increment of potential energy when the bead moves $x$ along the string from its center. Find that for small displacements the dependence of the increment of potential energy on $x$ is quadratic. Find how much the bead of mass $m$ will be displaced if it is given a small velocity $v$ at the equilibrium position.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            Initial energy of the electric field
$$ U_1=\frac{2kQq}{L} $$
Energy of the system after the bead is displaced
$$ U_2=\frac{kQq}{L-x}+\frac{kQq}{L+x} $$
Change in energy of the system
$$ \Delta U=U_2-U_1=kQq\left(\frac{1}{L-x}+\frac{1}{L+x}-\frac{2}{L}\right) $$
Let us consider the transformation for small values ​​of $(1+\xi )^\alpha =1+\alpha\xi$, where $\xi\ll1$
$$ \boxed{\Delta U  \approx\frac{Qqx^2}{2\pi\varepsilon_0L^3}} $$
From the principle of conservation of energy it follows that the kinetic energy will be equal to the change in electrical energy $\Delta U$
$$ E_k=\Delta U\Leftrightarrow \frac{m\upsilon^2}{2}=\frac{Qq\Delta x^2}{2\pi\varepsilon_0L^3} $$
Where do we find the change in length $\Delta x$
$$ \boxed{\Delta x=\upsilon\sqrt{\frac{m\pi\varepsilon_0L^3}{Qq}}} $$

        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$\Delta U=\frac{Qqx^2}{2\pi\varepsilon_0L^3};\quad\Delta x=\upsilon\sqrt{\frac{m\pi\varepsilon_0L^3}{Qq}}$$
