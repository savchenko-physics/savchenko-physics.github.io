        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
          Tension in each thread is the same ($T=mg$). Moreover, note that the absolute value of the sum of two any tensions must be equal to the third one which is also $T$ and be directed in opposed sense for maintain the equilibrium. So, consider for example the angle $\gamma$

        </center>

        <p>
          $$T_R = T = 2T\cos{\frac{\gamma}{2}}$$
          Hence
          $$\cos{\frac{\gamma}{2}} = 0.5$$
          $$\gamma = \frac{2\pi}{3} = 120^\circ$$
          But, since the above condition of the sum of two any tensions always is true, the three angles must be equal.
          $$\boxed{\alpha=\beta=\gamma=120^\circ}$$
