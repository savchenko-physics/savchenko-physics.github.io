        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $2.1.46.$ Two bodies of the same mass connected by a thread slide along an inclined plane. Thread tension force $T$. There is no friction between one body and the board. Determine the friction force between the board and another body.
        </p>

<p>
1. Since bodies of the same mass move down the plane with a stretched thread, the upper body will have a rough surface. The bodies will have the same accelerations with a stretched thread.
</p>
<p>
2. Let's write the equations of Newton's second law in projection on the direction of motion for each body separately:
$$ \left\{\begin{matrix}
        m_1g\,\sin\alpha -T=m_1a_1 & \\
        m_1g\,\sin\alpha +T-F_т=m_2a_2 &
        \end{matrix}\right. $$

$$ a_1=a_2 $$

$$ m_1=m_2 $$

$$ mg\,\sin\alpha +T-F_т=mg\,\sin\alpha -T $$

$$ F_т=2T $$
</p>
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$F = 2T$$
        </p>
