        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $1.5.9^*.$ The thread wound on the axis of the coil is pulled at a speed $v$ at an angle $\alpha$ to the horizon. The reel rolls along a horizontal plane without slipping. Find the speed of the axis and the angular velocity of the rotation of the coil. At what angles does the $\alpha$ axis move to the right? to the left? The thread is so long that the angle $\alpha$ does not change when moving.

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            <p>We denote the radius of the circle along which the coil rolls around the instantaneous axis by $ R^* $:</p>
<p class="exp">$$ R^* = R \cos \alpha - r $$</p>

<p>The angular velocity of the coil $ \omega $ is defined as the ratio of the linear velocity to the radius:</p>
<p class="exp">
$$  \omega = \frac{v}{R \cos \alpha - r}  $$
</p>

<p>The velocity of the axis $ v_0 $ can be found by considering the rotation of the coil as a movement around the center $ O $:</p>
<p class="exp">$$ v_0 = \omega R $$</p>

<p>We substitute the found angular velocity:</p>
<p class="exp">
$$  v_0 = \frac{v R}{R \cos \alpha - r}  $$
</p>

<p>The coil will move to the right if the velocity $ v_0 $ is positive, and to the left if $ v_0 $ is negative. The condition for changing direction is:</p>
<p class="exp">$$ R \cos \alpha = r $$</p>

<p>Accordingly, the critical angle $ \alpha^* $ is determined from:</p>
<p class="exp">
$$  \cos \alpha^* = \frac{r}{R}  $$
</p>

        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $u=\frac{v R}{R \cos \alpha-r} ;$ $ \omega=\frac{v}{R \cos \alpha-r}$ to the right at $\cos \alpha>r / R $, left at $\cos \alpha < r/R$
        </p>
