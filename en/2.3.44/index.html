        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $2.3.44.$ An unstretched rubber cord of length $2l$ is attached to the walls by its ends. A weight of mass $m$ was attached to the middle of the cord, which was then released without a push. When vibrations occur, the greatest distance to which the load is lowered is $x_0$. What is the stiffness of this cord?

<p>
Potential energy of the weight:
$$E_p = -mgx_0 $$
Potential energy of rubber cord
$$E_p' = k' \frac{(\sqrt{l^2 + x_0^2} - l)^2}{2}$$
From the law of conservation of energy, the total energy of the system must equal zero
$$E = 0 = E_p + E_p' + E_p'$$
It follows from the figure that the stretching of the cord is
$$\Delta L = \sqrt{l^2 + x_0^2} - l$$

Since we now consider them as separate springs, cords, we use superposition:
$$\frac{1}{k} = \frac{1}{k'} + \frac{1}{k'} \implies k' = 2k $$
From where stiffness of the cord could be found as
$$mgx_0 = \frac{2 \cdot 2k \cdot \left(\sqrt{l^2 + x_0^2} - l \right)^2}{2}$$

$$\boxed{k = \frac{mgx_0}{2 \cdot \left( \sqrt{l^2 + x_0^2} - l \right)^2}}$$
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$k = \frac{mgx_0}{2 \cdot \left( \sqrt{l^2 + x_0^2} - l \right)^2}$$
