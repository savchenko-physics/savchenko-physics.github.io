            $1.3.10.$ The duck was flying in a horizontal straight line with a constant speed $u$. An inexperienced "hunter" threw a stone at it, and the throw was made without pre-emption, i.e. at the time of the throw, the speed of the stone $v$ was directed just at the duck at an angle $\alpha$ to the horizon. At what height did the duck fly, if the rock still hit it?

Let's consider this equation of motion:
$$ y = h = \nu \sin \alpha - \frac{gt^{2}}{2} $$
It is known that:
$$ \left\{\begin{matrix}
S_{yt}=ut \\
S_{o}=\nu t \cos \alpha
\end{matrix}\right. $$
For angle $\alpha$:
$$ \tan \alpha = \frac{h}{S_{o} - S_{yt}} = \frac{h}{t(\nu \cos \alpha - u)} $$
We substitute the value of the angle $\alpha$ into the equation for the height:
$$ h = t (\nu \cos \alpha - u) \tan \alpha = \nu t \sin \alpha - \frac{gt^{2}}{2} $$
From this equation we can express time $t$:
$$ t = \frac{2u \tan \alpha}{g} $$
We substitute the time value $t$ back into the equation for height:
$$ \fbox{$h = \frac{2u \tan^{2} \alpha}{g} (\nu \cos \alpha - u)$} $$

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$h=\frac{2utg^{2}\alpha}{g}(\nu \cos\alpha -u)$$
