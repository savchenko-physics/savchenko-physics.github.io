        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            a) From Ampere's law, we find the magnetic field induction $B$
$$ F_1 = Il \cdot B \Rightarrow B = \frac{F}{Il}\quad(1) $$
in this case, the numbers acting on the part of the wire with currents $I_1$ and $I_2$, respectively
$$ F_1 = I_1l \cdot B; \quad F_2 = I_1L\cdot B $$
We substitute $(1)$:
$$ F_1= \frac{I_1}{I}F; \quad F_2 = \frac{I_1L}{Il}F $$
The force acting on a piece of wire bent at an angle $\varphi$ can be found from the cosine law
$$ |\vec{F_p}| = |\vec{F_1} + \vec{F_2}| = \sqrt{{F_1}^2+{F_2}^2+2  F_1 F_2\cdot\cos\varphi} $$

$$ \boxed{|\vec{F_p}| = F\frac{I_1}{I}\sqrt{1+\frac{L^2}{l^2} + 2\frac{L}{l}\cdot\cos\varphi}} $$
b) For a conductor made of a semicircle, we will use the same formula for the magnetic field induction $B$
$$ B = \frac{F}{Il} $$
On a small part of a conductor of length $dl$, the Ampere force acts
$$ dF = B I_2~dl = B I_2R~d\theta $$
To find the force $F$, we integrate the forces acting on each part of the semiring.
$$ F = \int\limits_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos\theta dF = BI_2R\int\limits_{-\frac{\pi}{2}}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}  \cos\theta~d\theta $$
After mathematical transformations, we obtain the force acting on the semiring
$$ \boxed{F = 2BI_2R = 2F\frac{I_2R}{Il}} $$

        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$F\frac{I_1}{I}\sqrt{1+\frac{L^2}{l^2} + 2\cos\varphi\frac{L}{l}};\quad2F\frac{I_2R}{Il}$$
