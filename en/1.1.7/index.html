        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $1.1.7.$ A submarine diving vertically and uniformly emits sound pulses of duration $\tau_0$. The duration of the pulse reflected from the bottom is $\tau$. The speed of sound in water is $c$. At what speed does the submarine dive?
        </p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
                          <p>
              Let's consider what the change of signal duration is related to. For this purpose, it is convenient to pass from the signal duration to its length. 
            </p>
              <p>
              Let the signal emitted by the sonar on the boat have the form shown in the figure, i.e. its intensity jumps from zero to some value at time $t$, remains constant during time $\tau_{0}$ and again jumps to zero at time $t + \tau_{0}$. 
            </p>
              <p>
              If the boat is stationary, the extent of the radiated signal (the distance between the leading and trailing edges) is $l_{0} = V \tau_{0}$. If the boat is sinking, the extent of the signal becomes smaller. 
            </p>
              <p>
              Indeed, let $AC = u \tau_{0}$, where $u$ is the submergence velocity of the boat. 
            </p>
              <p>
              The leading edge of the signal will move to point $B$ in time $\tau_{0}$, having travelled a distance $l_{0}$. 
            </p>
              <p>
              Hence, the signal length is equal to 
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
              $$l_{1} = BC = ( V - u ) \tau_{0}$$
            </p>
              <p>
              This signal reaches the bottom, discharges from it without changing its extent, and travels towards the boat.
            </p>
              <p>
              At some point in time, the leading edge of the signal will align with the boat.  
            </p>
              <p>
              The rear front of the signal continues to move with velocity $V + u$ relative to the boat, therefore, the duration of the signal received on the boat is equal to
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: center;">
$$\tau = \frac{l_{1} }{V + u} = \frac{(V - u) \tau_{0} }{V + u}$$
            </p>
              <p>
              From here
            </p>
              <p style="text-align: center;">
              $$u = V \frac{ \tau_{0} - \tau }{ \tau_{0} + \tau }$$
            </p>
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$v = c(\tau _{0} − τ)/(\tau _{0} + τ)$$
        </p>
