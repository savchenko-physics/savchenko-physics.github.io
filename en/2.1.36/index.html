        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $2.1.36.$ The velocity of a body of mass $m$ in a viscous liquid decreases with the distance $l$ traveled according to the law $v = v_0 - \beta l$, where $v_0$ is the initial velocity, and $\beta$ is a constant coefficient. How does the viscous friction force acting on a body from the fluid side depend on the velocity of the body?
        </p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            The equation of Newton's second law for the direction of motion:
$$ ma = F_с $$

$$ \frac{F_с}{m}=\frac{dv_x}{dt} $$
Derivative of velocity with respect to time
$$ \frac{dv_x}{dt}=\frac{d}{dt}(v_0-βx) $$

$$ \frac{dv_x}{dt}=\frac{dv_0}{dt}-β\frac{dx}{dt}=-βt $$
the minus sign shows that the acceleration vector is directed in the direction opposite to the velocity vector.
Combining the equations, we obtain the value of the resistance force as a function of velocity
$$ \boxed{F=βmv} $$

        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$F = βmv$$
        </p>
