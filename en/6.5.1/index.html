        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
          a) The absolute value of the electric field created by each plate is $E = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}$, between them is $2E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}$ (superposition). The force that acts over a differential of charge $dq$ is
          $$d\vec{F} = \vec{E}dq = \pm\frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}dq~\hat{E}$$
          As $dq = \pm\sigma~dS$,
          $$dF = \frac{\sigma^2~dS}{2\varepsilon_0}$$
          and moving $dS$ to another member of equation,
          $$\boxed{P_e=\frac{dF}{dS}=\frac{\sigma^2}{2\varepsilon_0}}$$
          b) Let's see following figure
        </p>
        <center>
        <figure>
          <img src="drawb.png"
            loading="lazy" alt="6.5.1" width="300" />

            Electric field of plates
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </center>
        <p>
          According to superposition principle between plates, $\vec{E_1}+\vec{E_2} = \vec{0}$, hence, $\vec{E_1}=-\vec{E_2}$ or $E_1 = E_2 = \frac{\sigma}{2\varepsilon_0}$. So, plates must have charges of same sign (+) or (-). The outside field is
          $$\vec{E} = \vec{E_1} + \vec{E_2}$$
          $E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}$
          $$\boxed{\sigma = \varepsilon_0 E} \;(1)$$
          The force that acts over an element of charge $dq$ in a plate is $dF_i = E_i~dq$ (i =1,2), but $E_i = \frac{E}{2}$ so,
          $$dF = \frac{E}{2}dq = \frac{E}{2}\sigma~dS$$
          Hence,
          $$P_e = \frac{dF}{dS} = \frac{\sigma E}{2} \;(2)$$
          Putting $(1)$ into $(2)$
          $$\boxed{P_e = \frac{\varepsilon_0~E^2}{2}}$$
          c) See following figure
        </p>
        <center>
        <figure>
          <img src="drawc.png"
            loading="lazy" alt="6.5.1" width="300" />
          <figcaption>
            Electric field of plates
          </figcaption>
        </figure>
        </center>
        <p>
          Superposition of electric fields must be zero outside of capacitor, so $\vec{E_1} = -\vec{E_2}$, so plates must have opposed signs. Inside is valid that $\vec{E_1} = \vec{E_2}$ so,
          $$\vec{E} = 2\vec{E_1} = 2\vec{E_2}$$
          $$E = \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon_0}$$
          with $\varepsilon_0$=8.85$\times$10$^{-12}$ F/m
          <div class="scroll-wrapper">
            $$\boxed{\sigma = \varepsilon_0~E = 8.85\times10^{-6}~\rm{C/m^2}=8.85~\rm{\mu C/m^2}} \;(4)$$
          </div>
          Since $P_e = \frac{\sigma^2}{2\varepsilon_0}$ and According $(4)$
          $$\boxed{P_e = \frac{\varepsilon_0~E^2}{2}=4.425~\rm{Pa}}$$
