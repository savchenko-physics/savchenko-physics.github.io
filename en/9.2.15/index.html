        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $9.2.15.$ a) The metal ring broke when the current in the ring was $I_0$. They made exactly the same ring, but from a material whose tensile strength was ten times greater. What current will break the new ring? </p><p>
b) What current will break the new ring, made from this stronger material, if all the dimensions of the new ring are twice the dimensions of the old one?
        </p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            a) Having carried out calculations similar to those in the problem <a href="../9.1.15">9.1.15</a>, we obtain that the limit force $F = IBR$, and since $B \sim \frac{I}{R}$, then $F \sim I^2$ <br><br>
Then it is obvious that when $F$ increases by 10 times, the current $I$ only needs to be increased by $\sqrt{10}$ times
$$ \boxed{I = I_0\sqrt{10}} $$
b) When the linear dimensions increase, the resistance increases, which means the current strength decreases; here the linear dimensions are increased by 2 times, which means that to achieve the same strength, a current twice as large is needed:
$$ \boxed{I = 2I_0\sqrt{10}} $$

        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$I = I_0\sqrt{10}; \quad I = 2I_0\sqrt{10}$$
        </p>
