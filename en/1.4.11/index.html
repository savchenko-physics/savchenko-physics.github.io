        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $1.4.11.$ The body is dropped over the slab at a height $h$ from it. The slab moves vertically upwards at a speed of $u$. Determine the time between two consecutive impacts of the body on the slab. The blows are absolutely elastic.
        </p>

        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>
            <p>Let's move to the reference frame associated with the plate. At the initial moment of time, the relative velocity is $u$ and is directed downwards.</p>
<p>From the law of conservation of energy, we find the velocity of the body $v$ at the moment before the impact</p>
<p class="exp">
$$  \frac{mv^2}{2} = \frac{mu^2}{2} + mgh $$
</p>
<p>Where is the desired velocity </p>
<p class="exp">$$v = \sqrt{u^2+2gh}$$</p>
<p>In this inertial reference frame, after an elastic rebound, the relative velocity will only change direction.</p>
<p>A body thrown vertically will land after time</p>
<p class="exp">
$$  t = \frac{2v}{g} $$
</p>
<p>Time sought:</p>
<p class="exp">
$$ \fbox{$t = \frac{2\sqrt{u^2 + 2gh}}{g}$} $$
</p>
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$t = 2\sqrt{u^2/g^2 + 2h/g}$$
        </p>
