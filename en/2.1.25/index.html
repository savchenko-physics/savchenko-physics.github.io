        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $2.1.25.$ A thread spanned over a block with a fixed axis is passed through a slot. At the ends of the thread are suspended loads, the mass of which is $m_1$ and $m_2$. Determine the acceleration of loads if a constant frictional force $F_{tr}$ acts on the thread from the side of the slot when it moves.

1. Due to the weightlessness and non-stretchability of the thread, as well as the ideal properties of the block (no losses and low weight), the problem can be solved in the following approximation)
$$ a_1=a_2=a $$

$$ T_1=T_2=T $$
2. The equations of motion of loads in projection onto the vertical axis in this case are written as follows:
$$ \left\{\begin{matrix}
          m_1a = m_2g - T \\
          m_2a =T-m_2g-F_{fr}
          \end{matrix}\right. $$
3. Solving the equations together, we obtain
$$ a=\frac{(m_1-m_2)g-F_{fr}}{m_1+m_2} $$
4. Substituting the acceleration value into the first equation of the system allows us to determine the tension of the thread
$$ \boxed{T=m_1\frac{2m_2g+F_{fr}}{m_1+m_2}} $$
</p>
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$T=m_1\frac{2m_2g+F_{fr}}{m_1+m_2}$$
