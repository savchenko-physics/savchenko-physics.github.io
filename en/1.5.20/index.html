        <h3> Statement </h3>
        <p>
            $1.5.20.$ The reel of tape is played back during time $t$ at the film drawing speed $v$. The initial radius of the reel (with film) is $R$, and the final radius (without film) is $r$. What is the thickness of the film?
        </p>

<p>Film wound on a reel takes up an area</p>
<p>
$$ S = \pi (R^2 - r^2) $$
</p>
<p>If the film is completely unwound at a speed of $v$ in time $t$, then the length of the film </p>
<p>
$$ l = vt $$
</p>
<p>In cross-section, the film is a rectangle whose area is $S$ and length is $l$. Then the width of this rectangle (it is also the thickness of the film)</p>
<p>
$$ \fbox{$d = \frac{S}{l} = \frac{\pi (R^2 - r^2)}{vt}$} $$
</p>
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$d = \frac{\pi (R^2 - r^2)}{vt}$$
