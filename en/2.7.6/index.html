        <p>
            $2.7.6.$ A thin-walled cylinder of radius $R$ was spun up to an angular velocity $\omega$ and placed in a corner, as shown in the figure. The coefficient of friction between the corner walls and the cylinder is $\mu$. How many revolutions will the cylinder make before it comes to a complete stop?

Conditions of equilibrium:
$$\left\{\begin{matrix}
O'X\text{: }F_{fr2} = N_1 \\
O'Y\text{: }F_{fr1}+N_2 = mg \\
\end{matrix}\right.$$
From where
$$\left\{\begin{matrix}
\mu N_2=N_1 \\
\mu N_1+N_2=mg \\
\end{matrix}\right.$$
Let's find friction force
$$F_{fr}=F_{fr1}+F_{fr2}$$
$$F_{fr}=\mu (N_1+N_2)=\mu N_2(1+\mu)$$

Considering, $mg = N_2(1+\mu ^2)$:
$$N=\frac{mg}{1+\mu ^2}$$

According to rotational motion dynamics, the sum of moments of external forces can be written as
$$M=I\varepsilon = mR^2=F_{fr} R$$
From where, absolute value of angular acceleration is found as 
$$\varepsilon = \frac{M}{I} = \frac{F_{fr}}{mR}$$
$$\varepsilon = \frac{\mu(1+\mu)N_2 }{mR}$$
$$\varepsilon = \frac{\mu(1+\mu)}{1+\mu ^2} \frac{g}{R}$$
The angle by which the cylinder will rotate to the moment of total stop is
$$\varphi=\frac{\omega ^2t}{2\varepsilon}$$
Until the total stop, the cylinder will make $N$ total turnovers
$$\varphi=2\pi N$$
From where 
$$N=\frac{\omega ^2t}{4\pi \varepsilon}$$
$$\boxed{N=\frac{1+\mu^{2}}{4\pi \mu(1+\mu)}\frac{\omega^{2}R}{g}}$$
        </p>

        <h4>Answer</h4>
        <p>
            $$N=\omega^{2}R(1+\mu^{2})/[4\pi g\mu(1+\mu)]$$
        </p>
